# Bucketlist Map with Pins

I wanted to create a map with pins that indicate the destinations that I would like to travel to in the future. There are two colors of pins. One color indicates places I've been and the other indicates places I'd like to visit. Each pin has a popup that has the name and a description of what I would like to see or do when visiteing the destination, or what I enjoyed when I was there.
